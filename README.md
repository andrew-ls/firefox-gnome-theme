# Firefox GNOME Theme

![Screenshot of the theme](screenshot.png)

## Description

This is a bunch of CSS code to make Firefox 57+ look closer to GNOME's default
theme. It styles the UI and internal Firefox' pages like `about:` and
`view-source:`. Both light and dark variants are supported.

The `master` branch is currently tracking **Firefox 64**. If you need support
for older versions, they are archived under version-specific git tags. Not every
contiguous Firefox release has a tag, so if there isn't one for your version use
the closest version under yours.

E.g. if you're using Firefox 63 there's no `63` tag, so you'll need to checkout
the closest version tag under that, which is `60`:

```sh
git checkout 60
```

You can list available tags with:

```sh
git tag --list
```



## Installation

Extensions can no longer style UI elements, but we can still use good old
`userChrome.css` and `userContent.css` files. Just drop this repo to your
`chrome` directory:

1. Go to your Firefox profile's directory, if it's located in the default
location, this should work:

	```sh
	cd ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default
	```

2. Create a `chrome` directory if it doesn't exist.

	```sh
	mkdir -p chrome
	cd chrome
	```

3. Clone this repo to a subdirectory:

	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/kurogetsusai/firefox-gnome-theme.git
	```

4. Create single-line user CSS files if non-existent or empty (at least one line
is needed for `sed`):

	```sh
	[[ -s userChrome.css ]] || echo >> userChrome.css
	[[ -s userContent.css ]] || echo >> userContent.css
	```

5. Import this theme at the beginning of the CSS files (all `@import`s must come
before any existing `@namespace` declarations):

	```sh
	sed -i '1s/^/@import "firefox-gnome-theme\/userChrome.css";\n/' userChrome.css
	sed -i '1s/^/@import "firefox-gnome-theme\/userContent.css";\n/' userContent.css
	```

6. Enable the theme in the `firefox-gnome-theme/userChrome.css` file. Open it
with a text editor and follow instructions to enable one of the theme variants.
You can also enable extra features here. Keep in mind this file might change in
future versions and your configuration will be lost. You can copy the `@import`s
you want to enable to the `userChrome.css` file directly in your `chrome`
directory if you want it to survive updates. Remember all `@import`s must be at
the top of the file, before other statements.

	The GTK theme variant must match the variant you picked for this Firefox
theme, which means you must either enable (for the dark variant) or disable (for
the light one) global dark theme in GNOME Tweak Tools, or alternatively, you
can run Firefox with a specific variant without changing the global theme by
supplying the `GTK_THEME` variable like this:

	```sh
	# for the dark theme
	GTK_THEME=Adwaita:dark firefox
	# for the light one
	GTK_THEME=Adwaita:light firefox
	```

7. Optionally you can enable styling of Firefox' internal pages in the
`userContent.css` file analogous to the `userChrome.css` file.

You might want to adjust your default link colors so they are more visible on
dark background, either drop the code below into your
`(firefox profile)/user.js` file or change them manually in `about:config`.

```js
user_pref("browser.active_color", "#cc1a1a");
user_pref("browser.anchor_color", "#0a8dff");
user_pref("browser.visited_color", "#0871cc");
user_pref("browser.display.background_color", "#2e3436");
user_pref("browser.display.foreground_color", "#ccc");
```

You can't get rid of the title bar for now (except for Fedora, where you can
enable CSD), but you will be able to do it in Firefox 60, when Firefox adds
client-side decoration support. For now you can use a GNOME extension like
[No Title Bar](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1267/no-title-bar/)
to hide it.

## Broken stuff

Icons might appear black where they should be white on some systems. I have no
idea why, but you can adjust them in the `ui/theme.css` file, look for
`filter: invert`.

I haven't finished styling the new tab page. I just replaced it with a
blank page, because I don't like all that clutter anyway, but feel free to
finish it yourself (my attempts are in the `userContent.css` file, look for
`about:newtab`).

Feel free to report issues here on GitHub and share your ideas if you know how
to fix them. Since I can't do everything alone, this project relies on
contributors, many existing features were added by our contributors, so don't
hesitate to become one of them!

## Development

If you wanna mess around the styles and change something, you might find these
things useful.

To use the Inspector to debug the UI, open the developer tools (F12) on any
page, go to options, check both of those:

- Enable browser chrome and add-on debugging toolboxes
- Enable remote debugging

Now you can close those tools and press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+I to Inspect the browser
UI.

Also you can inspect any GTK3 application, for example type this into a terminal
and it will run Epiphany with the GTK Inspector, so you can check the CSS styles
of its elements too.

```sh
GTK_DEBUG=interactive epiphany
```

Feel free to use any parts of my code to develop your own themes, I don't force
any specific license on your code.
